## Project Summary
A simulation-based study and prototype for intelligent electric vehicle (EV) route planning tailored to long-distance tourism. The project combines energy modelling, charging optimization, scenic-route integration, and a business/operational feasibility assessment.

## Key Objectives
- Simulate EV energy consumption over long trips (Wh/km, terrain and temperature effects).  
- Build a charging optimization module that chooses efficient charging stops.  
- Integrate points-of-interest (scenic/historic) to design tourist-friendly routes.  
- Produce dashboards and documentation to support a business case for autonomous EV tourism.

## Structure
- `/docs` – technical notes, roadmaps, risk analysis.  
- `/research` – competitor analysis and datasets.  
- `/simulation` – Jupyter notebooks and scripts.  
- `/design` – concept sketches, UI wireframes.  
- `/logs` – dated project log entries.

## Current status
**Phase:** Initialization — repository created and basic files added.

## How to use this repo
- Read `/docs/README.md` for project details.  
- Open `/simulation` for code and notebooks.  
- See `/logs` for a record of progress.
